# Calculating pme for real estate

Illustrates a method for calculating pme for real estate that we use at ASRS.  Same as private equity, except you have to construct a daily total return index for quarterly index return information.  We use linear interpolation.  You could just as easily use a constant daily return, but that seems falsely precise to us.
